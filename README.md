The program is a a simple tile-based game in C++ and SFML and was created just to have fun. 
It needs to go through a large refactoring. A huge portion of the code is stored in the main.cpp file

The following functionalities have been implemented:

- Input management, screen scrolling e player animation.
- Levels are loaded from a tileset file, which can be created using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/).
- A basic collision detection and a game state machine have been implemented.
